My name is Joelle Tasker and I am a PhD student in Government from the University of Essex. I am interested in public opinion, political behaviour and political psychology. My PhD project focuses on ideology in the UK, exploring how latent attitudes relate to self-placement in the left-right space, and how this has changed during the recent turbulent decade in British politics. I also work as a research assistant on the Project "Voter ID in the UK", which investigates the impact of the introdution of voter ID in the UK.

My methodological interests include quantiative analysis of survey research and survey experiments. I am particularly interested in understanding the way respondents interpret and respond to political questions, and how this differs from our expectations.
